## Sol-cli tool

An attempt at making a simple CLI tool to learn.

### Commands:

` sol --run-cpp ./path/to/your/cppfile `
Compiles and runs c++ files with one command because efficiency :P
(It's best to use this command where your file is because it will create an a.out file wherever you call it)

### Installation: (Linux Only)
1. Download the 'sol' file.
2. Move the file to /usr/bin (adding to PATH).
3. Make sure it has execute permission, before moving.

For Windows, you can compile 'sol.cpp' and add the .exe created to your environment variables
